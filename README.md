# Collection Setup
A lightroom plug-in that creates a number of collections and collection sets to simplify image management and workflow. 

This plug-in will create the following structure of smart collections and a collection set: 

* Spring, 2017 *--this name is entered in the dialog box* 
  * All *-- Smart Collection of all all images betweeen the start date and end date which are entered in the dialog box*
  * Pick *-- All images between the start date and end date that also have the Pick flag*
  * Select *-- All images between the start date and end date that have the pick flag and are of file type TIFF*
  * TIFF *-- All images between the start date and end date that are of file type TIFF*
